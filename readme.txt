Grow your email list with Viral Sign Ups & get your customers to easily refer friends and earn incentives for their referrals.

== Description ==

= Grow Your Email List =

Word of mouth is the most trusted form of marketing. Viral Sign Ups allows your site users to easily refer friends and earn incentives for their referrals.

Viral Sign Ups is a WordPress plugin that lets you design and launch a customer referral campaign to collect customer emails. It allows your site users to invite friends via multiple social channels like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn and email.

Easily place an email capture form anywhere on your website. When someone submits their email address they will be shown your custom message - i.e. "Want to $50 off your next purchase? Get 5 of your friends to sign up."

Each user is assigned a unique url link they can use to promote and invite their friends to your website page.

Viral Sign Ups tracks each invite and goal conversion to reward your customers for their referrals.



**Where your data is stored.**
Your data is stored on our server and your auto reply emails when a new user signs up or refers a friend are sent out from our server. This way we can insure everything works smoothly and you don't run into any difficulties with emails not being sent out.
